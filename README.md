# Project Overview
This project is a simple, modular app built using Swift, UIKit, Combine, Async/Await, and programmatic Auto Layout. It follows a pure MVVM architecture and adheres to clean coding practices.

The app consists of two main screens:

Login:
Users can enter their credentials with validation applied. The session is securely stored in the Keychain.

Home:
A Compositional Layout screen featuring a sliding Banner Section, a Categories Section, and a Product Section.

This project demonstrates modern Swift development practices, focusing on clean, modular, and maintainable code.
